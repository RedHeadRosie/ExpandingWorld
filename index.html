        Hello Travelers, <br />

          I have lived in several countries growing up and have met lots of
          interesting people. I love discovering new hobbies and front-end
          development has been a great find. I studied programming at university
          and have experience with JAVA, C++, C and I am learning about Python
          and C# at the moment, however, I enjoy web development the most.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used to teach and have a very creative mindset. I have had a
          painting in the Smithsonian Museum and I love looking for new ways to
          use my artistic skills. In my spare time I will always be working on a
          new art project.
        </p>
        <p>
          I live on a farm where my surroundings and the animals that live here
          are my inspiration. My cat, Kirby, is my editor and boss so his
          approval is everything to me.
        </p>
